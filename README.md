# jsonsimulator
Problem Statement: JSON Python Simulator
Objective:
Develop a Python-based JSON Simulator that can dynamically generate, manipulate, and simulate interactions with JSON data structures. The simulator should be user-friendly and capable of handling real-world JSON use cases, such as API request/response testing, data validation, and mock data generation.

Key Features:

JSON Data Generation:

Allow users to define JSON schemas or templates.
Generate JSON data based on predefined rules, including randomization for testing purposes.
Support nested and complex JSON structures.
Manipulation and Editing:

Enable users to modify JSON data interactively or programmatically.
Provide support for adding, updating, or deleting specific fields or values.
Handle operations on arrays, nested objects, and conditional logic for field updates.
Simulation Capabilities:

Simulate API interactions, such as sending/receiving JSON payloads.
Provide options to simulate errors, such as missing fields or incorrect data types.
Test data consistency and structure against given JSON schemas.
Validation:

Validate JSON data against custom or standard schemas (e.g., JSON Schema Draft-07).
Detect and highlight structural or type mismatches in the data.
Logging and Reporting:

Log all operations performed on the JSON data.
Generate reports showing the history of modifications or interactions.
Integration:

Provide an interface for importing/exporting JSON data to/from external sources (e.g., files, APIs).
Support integration with Python testing frameworks like pytest.
Target Users:

Developers and testers working with APIs or JSON-based data.
Data engineers simulating data flows and transformations.
Anyone needing to generate or validate JSON data structures.
Technical Requirements:

Python 3.9+ compatibility.
Use standard libraries like json, with optional integration of libraries such as jsonschema, faker, or requests.
Command-line and optional graphical user interface for ease of use.
Modular design for future extensibility.
Success Metrics:

The tool should handle at least 95% of common JSON operations, including validation and manipulation.
It should be capable of processing JSON files of up to 10 MB without significant performance degradation.
Provide accurate validation feedback with actionable suggestions for correction.
